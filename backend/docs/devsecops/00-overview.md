# DevSecOps Overview

This project implements DevSecOps as an **operating model**, not a toolchain.

Security controls are applied:
- Early (shift-left)
- Continuously (CI/CD)
- Automatically (policy enforcement)
- Ephemerally (no persistent secrets)

The goal is to ensure **no insecure artifact reaches production**.
